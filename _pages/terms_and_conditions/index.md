the designated delay period per BUSL-1.1, customers must exercise caution and ensure that no sensitive or protected data 
is intertwined or at risk due to this transition. ReductStore does not assume responsibility for data compromised due

the methods we accept. Keep in mind that our fees encompass all applicable taxes, depending on where the payment takes place.

to provide you with the appropriate invoicing materials. This could potentially assist you in claiming refunds or credits 
for such taxes.

otherwise by the Customer. ReductStore reserves the right to revise service rates with a minimum 30-day notice prior to the next

from your payments, you will provide us with relevant documentation upon request.

disruptions in the service.

perform its obligations under this Agreement. Neither Party shall disclose, or permit to be disclosed, either
directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information of the other Party, except: (a) to its officers, employees,

this restriction and who are themselves bound by nondisclosure obligations at least as restrictive as those set forth
in this Agreement; or (b) where the Receiving Party becomes legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information.

Confidential Information of the other Party, and will take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own
confidential information of a like nature. The Receiving Party will use reasonable efforts to provide timely notice
