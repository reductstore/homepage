We are excited to announce the release
of [ReductStore Client SDK for C++ v1.3.0](https://github.com/reductstore/reduct-cpp/releases/tag/v1.3.0)! This release
includes support for the ReductStore API v1.3.0 with labels and content type.

## Labels

Since ReductStore v1.3.0, you can attach labels to data when writing and querying. Labels are key-value pairs that can be used
to classify and categorize data. For example, you might use labels to store metadata about a record, such as its md5 sum or class.

```cpp
auto [bucket, err] =  client->CreateBucket(kBucketName);

IBucket::Time ts = IBucket::Time() + std::chrono::microseconds(123109210);
std::string blob = "some blob of data";
bucket->Write("entry",
                    IBucket::WriteOptions{
                        .timestamp = ts,
                        .labels = IBucket::LableMap({"label1", "value3"}),
                    },
                    [&blob](auto rec) { rec->WriteAll(blob); });

```

This labels can be used to filter the results of a query:

```cpp
auto err = bucket->Query("entry", ts, ts + us(3), 
                         IBucket::QueryOptions{.include = IBucket::LabelMap({"label1", "value1"})},
                         [&all_data](auto record) {
                           auto read_err = record.Read([&all_data](auto data) {
                             all_data.append(data);
                             return true;
                           });

                           return true;
                         });

```

## Content Type

You can now specify the content type of the data you are writing to the ReductStore database. This could be useful for example
when you are writing a file to the database and want to store the file extension as the content type or keep information about
the image format.

```cpp
bucket->Write("entry", IBucket::WriteOptions{
                        .content_type = "image/png",
                    },
                    [&blob](auto rec) { rec->WriteAll(image_as_blob); });
```
