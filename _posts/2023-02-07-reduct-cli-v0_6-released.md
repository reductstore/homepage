Hello everyone,

We're excited to announce the release
of [version 0.6.0 of the Reduct CLI](https://github.com/reductstore/reduct-cli/releases/tag/v0.6.0)!
This release brings a number of new features for working with the new [ReductStore API v1.3](https://docs.reduct.store/http-api).

<!--more-->

### File Extensions for Export

Now the CLI client tries to guess the file extension for exported files based on the MIME type of the record.
You can also specify the file extension explicitly using the `--ext` option:

```
rcli export folder server_1/bucket_1 . --ext jpeg
```

### Filter by Labels

During the export to another ReductStore instance or a filesystem, you can filter entries by labels using the `--exclude` and `--include` options:

```
rcli export bucket server_1/bucket_1 server_2/bucket_1 --include animal=cat --exclude color=red
```

For more information, see the [documentation](https://cli.reduct.store/en/latest/docs/export/).
