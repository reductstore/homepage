Hey everyone!

[JavaScript SDK v0.3](https://github.com/reduct-storage/reduct-js/releases/tag/v0.3.0) has been released!
A few bugs were fixed and methods `Bucket.read` and `Bucket.write` use now the `Buffer` class instead of `string`, so that
you can integrate it into your application more efficiently:

```javascript
mqttClient.on('message', async (topic, msg) => {
    const data = msg.toString(); // No it is not needed!!!
    await bucket.write('mqtt_data', data);
    console.log('Received message "%s" from topic "%s" is written', data,
        topic);
});
```
