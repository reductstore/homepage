Hello, everyone!

We're excited to announce the release
of [ReductStore v1.2.0](https://github.com/reductstore/reductstore/releases/tag/v1.2.0). In this update, we've made some
important changes to
improve the way tokens and buckets are managed. Specifically, when you create a new token, the database will now check
to ensure that the buckets specified in the token's permissions actually exist. This will help prevent errors and ensure
that users have the proper access to the appropriate buckets.

We've also added a new endpoint, `GET /api/v1/me`, which allows users to retrieve their current permissions. This can be
useful for checking what actions a user is allowed to perform, or for debugging purposes.

In addition to these changes, we've made a few updates to the branding of the project. As you may know, ReductStore was
previously known as Reduct Storage. We decided to rename the project to ReductStore in order to have a shorter name and
a cool domain (https://reduct.store).

We hope these updates will improve your experience with ReductStore. As always, if you have any questions or feedback,
don't hesitate to reach out in [Discord](https://discord.gg/NQbPeGgzdR) or by opening a discussion
on [GitHub](https://github.com/reductstore/reductstore/discussions).

Thank you for using ReductStore!
