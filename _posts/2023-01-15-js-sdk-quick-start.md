This quick start guide will walk you through the process of installing and using the ReductStore JavaScript client SDK
to
interact with a [ReductStore](https://github.com/reductstore/reductstore) instance.

## Installing the SDK

To install the ReductStore SDK, you will need to have Node.js 16 or higher installed on your machine. Once Node.js is
installed, you can use the `npm` package manager to install the `reduct-js` package:

```
npm install reduct-js
```

## Running ReductStore as a Docker Container

If you don't already have a ReductStore instance running, you can easily spin one up as a Docker container. To do so,
run the following command:

```
docker run -p 8383:8383 reductstore/reductstore
```

This will start a ReductStore instance listening on port 8383 of your local machine.

## Using the SDK

Now that you have the `reduct-js` SDK installed and a ReductStore instance running, you can start using the SDK to
interact with the ReductStore instance.

Here is an example of using the JavaScript SDK to perform a few different operations on a bucket:

```javascript 
const {Client, QuotaType} = require("reduct-js");
const fs = require("fs");

const main = async () => {
    // Create a client
    const client = new Client("http://127.0.0.1:8383");

    // Get or create a bucket with 1Gb quota
    const bucket = await client.getOrCreateBucket("my-bucket",
        {quotaType: QuotaType.FIFO, quotaSize: BigInt(1e9)}
    );

    // The simplest case. Write some data with the current timestamp
    let record = await bucket.beginWrite("entry");
    await record.write("Hello, world!");

    // More complex case. Upload a file as a stream with a custom timestamp unix timestamp in microseconds
    const timestamp = Date.now() * 1000;
    record = await bucket.beginWrite("entry", timestamp);
    const fileStream = await fs.createReadStream(__filename);   // let's upload this file
    await record.write(fileStream, fs.statSync(__filename).size);

    // The simplest case. Read the data by a certain timestamp
    record = await bucket.beginRead("entry", timestamp);
    console.log(await record.readAsString());

    // More complex case. Iterate over all records in the entry and read them as steams
    function streamToString (stream) {
        const chunks = [];
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            stream.on("data", (chunk) => chunks.push(Buffer.from(chunk)));
            stream.on("error", (err) => reject(err));
            stream.on("end", () => resolve(Buffer.concat(chunks).toString("utf8")));
        });
    }

    for await (const record of bucket.query("entry")) {
        console.log(`Record timestamp: ${record.timestamp}`);
        console.log(`Record size: ${record.size}`);

        // Read the record as a stream
        await streamToString(record.stream);
    }

};

main().catch(e => console.error(e));
```

Let's break down what this example is doing.

### Creating a Client

To start interacting with the database, we need to create a client. You can use the `Client` class from the `reduct`
module. Pass the URL of the ReductStore instance you want to connect to as an argument to the `Client` constructor:

```javascript
// Create a client
const client = new Client("http://127.0.0.1:8383");
```

### Creating a Bucket

All data in ReductStore is stored in buckets. To get a bucket, you can use the `getOrCreateBucket` method on a `Client`.
This method creates a bucket if it does not already exist. Pass the name of the bucket you want to create along with
the bucket settings. In this example, we are creating a bucket with a quota of 1Gb. It means that the database will
start removing old data once the bucket reaches 1Gb:

```javascript
// Get or create a bucket with 1Gb quota
const bucket = await client.getOrCreateBucket("my-bucket",
    {quotaType: QuotaType.FIFO, quotaSize: BigInt(1e9)}
);
```

### Writing data to a Bucket

To write data to a bucket, you can use the `beginWrite` method on a `Bucket` instance. Pass the name of the entry you
want to write. The `beginWrite` method returns a `WritableRecord` object that you can use to write data to the bucket.
The `beginWrite` method will use current time as the timestamp for the entry if it is not specified:

```javascript
// The simplest case. Write some data with the current timestamp
let record = await bucket.beginWrite("entry");
await record.write("Hello, world!");
```

The `WritableRecord.write` method accepts a `ReadbleStream` object as an argument, so you can use it to write data from
a file or any other source:

```javascript
const timestamp = Date.now() * 1000;
record = await bucket.beginWrite("entry", timestamp);
const fileStream = await fs.createReadStream(__filename);   // let's upload this file
await record.write(fileStream, fs.statSync(__filename).size);
```

Pay attention that the `write` method has to know the size of the written data in advance.

### Reading data from a Bucket

To read data from a bucket, you can use the `beginRead` method on a `Bucket` instance.
Pass the name and timestamp of the entry you want to read.
The `beginRead` method returns a `ReadableRecord` object with information about the record and method `read` to read the
content:

```javascript 
// The simplest case. Read the data by a certain timestamp
record = await bucket.beginRead("entry", timestamp);
console.log(await record.readAsString());
```

To iterate over all entry in a bucket, you can use the `query` method on a `Bucket` instance:

```javascript
// More complex case. Iterate over all records in the entry and read them as steams
function streamToString (stream) {
    const chunks = [];
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        stream.on("data", (chunk) => chunks.push(Buffer.from(chunk)));
        stream.on("error", (err) => reject(err));
        stream.on("end", () => resolve(Buffer.concat(chunks).toString("utf8")));
    });
}

for await (const record of bucket.query("entry")) {
    console.log(`Record timestamp: ${record.timestamp}`);
    console.log(`Record size: ${record.size}`);

    // Read the record as a stream
    await streamToString(record.stream);
}
```

In this example, we iterate over all entries in the bucket and read them as streams. However, you can use the `start`
and `stop` arguments to specify a time interval for the records you want to
retrieve. The `start` argument specifies the beginning of the time interval, and the `stop` argument specifies the end of
the time interval. Both arguments are timestamps in UNIX microseconds:

```javascript
const startTs = 1609459200000000  // January 1, 2021 at 00:00:00
const stopTs = 1609827200000000   // January 31, 2021 at 23:59:59
for await (const record of bucket.query("entry", startTs, stopTs)) {
    console.log(`Record timestamp: ${record.timestamp}`);
    console.log(`Record size: ${record.size}`);
    console.log(`Record content: ${await record.read()}`);
    //...
}
```
