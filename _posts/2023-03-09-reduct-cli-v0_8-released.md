Hey, I've released [version 0.8.0](https://github.com/reductstore/reduct-cli/releases/tag/v0.8.0) of Reduct CLI, the
Python package for managing data stored in [ReductStore](https://www.reduct.store/). This release includes two new
features that will be particularly helpful for [our public datasets hosted]() on ReductStore, where metadata can be used
to provide important context for the data.

1. The `rcli export folder` command now has a new option `--with-metadata`, which exports meta information about a
   record and its labels into a JSON file along with the content of the record.

2. The `rcli export` commands now accept integers for `--start` and `--stop` options, which means you can specify a time
   interval in Unix time or use it as a range of record IDs if you don't care about time:

   ```
    # Export records with ID from 0 to 5 
    rcli export folder instance/bucket ./export_path --start 0 --stop 5
   ```


I hope these new features make it even easier to work with ReductStore and manage your data. As always, if you have any
questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out! 

Thanks for using [ReductStore](https://www.reduct.store)!
