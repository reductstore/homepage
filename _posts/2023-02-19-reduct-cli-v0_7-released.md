Hey everyone,

I'm happy to announce that we have
released [Reduct CLI client v0.7.0](https://github.com/reductstore/reduct-cli/releases/tag/v0.7.0) with some minor
improvements and bug fixes. We started using the tool in real applications and faced some problems exporting data from a
ReductStore instance when the connection is slow and we have many entries to download asynchronously.

First of all, it wasn't very convenient to count all needed entries in the `rcli export` command. Now we can use
wildcards:

```
rcli export folder instance/bucket ./export_path  --entries=sensor-*
```

<!--more-->

More over, the `rcli export` command used the query API with default TTL 5 seconds for a query. When the internet
connection was slow, it may have taken more than 5 seconds to request the next record in the query. The query could
expire and the CLI would receive the 404 HTTP error. Now the CLI client uses the TTL equal to the number of parallel
tasks multiplied by the timeout. By default, the TTL is 50 seconds (10 parallel tasks * 5 second timeout). This makes
the data export more robust and allows a user to change the TTL by using the `parallel` and `timeout` options.

```
rcli --parallel 5 --timeout 3 export folder  instance/bucket ./export_path # TTL is 15 second
```
